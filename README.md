# 🧬 Breast Cancer Classification with Machine Learning

This project builds and compares machine learning models to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on clinical features. It demonstrates how machine learning can aid in early cancer detection, which is essential for improving patient outcomes.

## 📊 Overview

Using a structured breast cancer dataset, I trained and evaluated three classification models:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

I then compared their performance to identify the most accurate method for predicting breast cancer diagnosis.

## 📂 Dataset

- **File name:** `[Dataset]_BreastCancer.csv`
- **Source:** Unknown (original source not specified)
- **Contents:** The dataset includes numeric features such as radius, perimeter, texture, area, and a target label indicating whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T66Jt1HCUhWU-PlFtXqJCJEjMuHvlEwd?usp=sharing)
2. Upload the dataset file named `[Dataset]_BreastCancer.csv` when prompted.
3. Run all cells in order to preprocess the data, train the models, and view the results.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Google Colab)
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** – Data processing
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Model building and evaluation
